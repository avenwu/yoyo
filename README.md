YoYo
======

![YoYo Logo](app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.png)

YoYo GitHub is an android application based on open api provided by GitHub team.
For more information see [the website][1]


Why
--------

GitHub hosts thousands of open-source projects, it would be nice to have an well designed android
 client; however they are focused mainly on web side feature and have stopped maintaining the
 official android application. So I decided to make one to satisfy myself.

This project will follow the [material design][2] style, you may fork and make changed freely under
the LICENCE

Preview
--------

Attention! YoYo is currently in develop, these are some screenshots for early preview.

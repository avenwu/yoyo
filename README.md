YoYo GitHub is an android application based on open api provifed by github team.
For more information see [the website][1]


Why
--------

Github hosts thousands of open-source projects, it would be nice to have an well designed android client;
however github team are focused mainly on web side feature and have stopped maintaining the official android application.
So I decided to make one to satisfy myself.

This project will follow the material design style, you may fork and make changed freely under the LICENCE
